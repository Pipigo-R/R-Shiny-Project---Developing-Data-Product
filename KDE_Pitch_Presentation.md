Project Introduction
========================================================
Thisis a simple Shiny App generated for peer assessed assignment. The Assignment includes 2 parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

- Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. 
- Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
<https://binghuzk.shinyapps.io/kdeproject/>
- The supporting documentation linked in the application
<https://binghuzk.shinyapps.io/KDE_APP/>

App Introduction
========================================================
This APP is for KDE Estimation.
- In statistics, kernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. Kernel density estimation is a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made, based on a finite data sample. 
- Let (x1, x2, …, xn) be independent and identically distributed samples drawn from some univariate distribution with an unknown density ƒ at any given point x. 
- We are interested in estimating the shape of this function ƒ. kernal is the a non-negative function of kernel density estimator. 
- A range of kernel functions are commonly used: Uniform, triangular, biweight, triweight, Epanechnikov, Gaussian, and others. 



Parameters Used in the Application
========================================================
Kernel density estimates are closely related to histograms, but can be endowed with properties such as smoothness or continuity by using a suitable kernel. 
- Number of bins (Input text box Enter number 1 - 50 and default number is 25)
- Number of observations (Input slider with range 10 -1000).
Those two parameters gives histogram.

Once check the check box of "Show Density Estimate", you can select the following 2 parameters:
- kernal type 
- Bandwidth selection: The bandwidth of the kernel is a free parameter which exhibits a strong influence on the resulting estimate. (Input Slider with range from 0.2 - 2) 


Delivery of APP
========================================================
Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation

After made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what needed

5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box
